# AI Agents Instructions

If file `.AGENTS.sh.completed` exists, it means that environment was already setup for you and all relevant dependencies are installed / downloaded.
If it does not exist, setup the environment by running the script: `./AGENTS.sh`

Activate the virtual environment before running any commands:

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
```

Check README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md at the project root and under relevant subdirectories for more information.
